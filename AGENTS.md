# VS Code Agents Instructions

This file provides instructions for AI coding agents working with the VS Code codebase.

For detailed project overview, architecture, coding guidelines, and validation steps, see the [Copilot Instructions](.github/copilot-instructions.md).

## Hucode fork notes

- A shallow import of a VS Code release tag is not enough for the first push to
  `origin`. Before publishing the repo, fetch enough history for the selected
  release line and fetch reachable Git LFS objects, or GitHub may reject the
  push with missing object errors.
- Hucode product identity is applied through the tracked overlay under
  `build/hucode/mixin/stable/` and staged into the working tree only for
  Hucode-specific wrapper commands. Keep root `product.json` as upstream OSS.
- Workbench `TreeView` selection/reveal paths operate on the live `ITreeItem`
  instances in the tree model, not synthetic `{ handle }` placeholders. Cache
  and reuse the provider-produced items when restoring selection.
